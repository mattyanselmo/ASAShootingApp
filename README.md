# ASAShootingApp

This repository contains an R Shiny web app to explore Major League Soccer data. The underlying data is updated weekly.

Large raw files are stored in a private repository, where they are cleaned and compressed into aggregated tables for use in the app. The app can be run without these large raw files, so you can run it from here! All app data is stored fittingly in the AppData directory, and all custom functions used in the can be found the Functions directory.

The app UI and server code is contained in the ui.R, server.R, and global.R files.

If you are interested in helping to develop the app, please contact mkullowatz at gmail dot com.
